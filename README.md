# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in various programming languages.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

*   **`01-Data-Structures`:** Contains implementations of various data structures.
*   **`02-Algorithms`:** Contains implementations of various algorithms.

Within these main folders, there are subfolders for each specific data structure or algorithm.

### `01-Data-Structures`

This folder houses different implementations of data structures. The current structure is as follows:

*   **`00_DynamicallyResizableArray`:** Implementations of dynamically resizable arrays (often called ArrayLists or Vectors).
*   **`01_SinglyLinkedList`:** Implementations of singly linked lists.
*   **`02_SinglyCircularLinkedList`:** Implementations of singly circular linked lists.
*   **`03_DoublyLinkedList`:** Implementations of doubly linked lists.
*   **`04_DoublyCircularLinkedList`:** Implementations of doubly circular linked lists.
*   **`05_Stack`:** Implementations of the Stack data structure.
*   **`06_Queue`:** Implementations of the Queue data structure.
*   **`07_BST`:** Implementations of Binary Search Trees.

### `02-Algorithms`

This folder contains various algorithm implementations:

*   **`01_SelectionSort`:** Implementations of the Selection Sort algorithm.
*   **`02_BinarySearch`:** Implementations of the Binary Search algorithm.
*   **`03_BinarySearchRecursiveAproach`:** Implementations of Binary Search algorithm using recursion.

## TODO (Future Improvements)

*   Add more data structures and algorithms.
*   Add implementations in different programming languages.
*   Include visual aids and diagrams.
*   Include performance analysis and benchmarking.
*   Add more complex examples and coding problems.
