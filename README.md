# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in various programming languages. It's designed to be a learning resource for anyone interested in understanding these core computer science concepts.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

*   **`01-Data-Structures`:** Contains implementations of various data structures.
*   **`02-Algorithms`:** Contains implementations of various algorithms.

Within these main folders, there are subfolders for each specific data structure or algorithm.

### `01-Data-Structures`

This folder houses different implementations of data structures. The current structure is as follows:

*   **`00_DynamicallyResizableArray`:** Implementations of dynamically resizable arrays (often called ArrayLists or Vectors).
*   **`01_SinglyLinkedList`:** Implementations of singly linked lists.
*   **`02_SinglyCircularLinkedList`:** Implementations of singly circular linked lists.
*   **`03_DoublyLinkedList`:** Implementations of doubly linked lists.
*   **`04_DoublyCircularLinkedList`:** Implementations of doubly circular linked lists.
*   **`05_Stack`:** Implementations of the Stack data structure.
*   **`06_Queue`:** Implementations of the Queue data structure.
*   **`07_BST`:** Implementations of Binary Search Trees.

### `02-Algorithms`

This folder contains various algorithm implementations:

*   **`01_SelectionSort`:** Implementations of the Selection Sort algorithm.
*   **`02_BinarySearch`:** Implementations of the Binary Search algorithm.
*   **`03_BinarySearchRecursiveAproach`:** Implementations of Binary Search algorithm using recursion.

## How to Use

1.  **Navigate:** Browse the folders to find the specific data structure or algorithm you are interested in.
2.  **Code:** The implementations will be within their corresponding folder, along with any associated explanations or comments.
3.  **Experiment:** Feel free to copy, modify, and experiment with the code for learning purposes.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or want to add a new data structure or algorithm, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork:** Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Create Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or fix (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`).
3.  **Implement:** Make your changes, ensuring the code is well-documented and tested.
4.  **Test:** Include any necessary tests.
5.  **Commit:** Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message (`git commit -m "Add: Description of the changes"`).
6.  **Push:** Push your changes to your branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`).
7.  **Pull Request:** Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.

## Code Style

Please ensure that your code is well-formatted and follows a consistent style. When possible, follow the coding conventions of your chosen programming language (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
